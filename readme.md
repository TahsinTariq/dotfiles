# Making my custom dotfiles
## TODO :
 - This is only for GNOME DE. Customize for KDE.
 - Maybe have option to switch to i3-gaps, DWM, BSPWM?
 - Current Supported package manager is apt. Customize for others (mostly Pacman).
 - Need to update readme.
 - Write script with optional arguments to call from CLI?
